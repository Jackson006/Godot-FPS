The `master` branch is the current working branch. The `master` branch may not be in working condition and will likely change as the tutorial is developed. Only use `master` if you are looking for the latest code from the tutorial.

You can find a working version of the tutorial on the Godot documentation!

The FPS project here on Github currently uses Godot 3.1! Be sure to use Godot 3.1 (or a daily/master build) if you plan on running the project from this repository!
